# Task List Frontend

A plain TypeScript frontend that lists all tasks and shows a form to create a new task.
Implemented without any framework to keep things as simple as possible. DOM manipulation is done
by using `document.getElementById("...").innerHTML = ...`.


## Project Setup

### Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Bundle

```sh
npm run build
```

Now you can open `/dist/index.html` in your browser.
